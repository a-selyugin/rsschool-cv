## About me:
For the last 3 years I've been working as a Product Manager in company producing HW/SW solutions for marine automation. Being responsible for product design made me understand that I'm an adherent of pixel-perfect execution of technical tasks. Also I took over company internal website designed for automatic generation of technical documentation as a side project. This made me understand that I want to continue my career as a web developer.

Previously worked as a Project Manager and Service Engineer. 

Good communication skills, reliable and responsible, love to help people.
